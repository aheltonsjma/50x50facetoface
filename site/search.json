The artist describes her often domestic-feeling interior spaces “like a movie set,”2 in which objects with assorted histories and styles evoke specific anecdotes. However, she teases out their eccentricities and poetry to build layered meaning. Bloom never tells a complete or straightforward story. Rather, her works imply potential narratives to be completed by the viewer.\n Barbara Bloom, in a discussion with Simon Critchley, Robert Storr, and Joerg Heiser, “Scenes from a Marriage: Have Art and Theory Drifted Apart?,” Frieze Talks, Frieze Art Fair, London, October 16, 2009, audio, 1:28:15, https://frieze.com/fair-programme/listen-scenes-marriage. ↩ Margot Mifflin, “Barbara Bloom,” ARTnews 92 (February 1993): 103. ↩   ","id":6,"length":166,"title":"Bloom Banner.

Borrowing this expression for the title, Barbara Bloom’s 1988 installation captures a sense of the unknown. The end is visible from the entrance of its four successive rooms, but their enigmatic contents, framed and reframed as one moves through the spaces, suggest the limits of visibility.1 Framed Braille texts and words too small to read hang on the walls; a saucer-shaped dish holds a hologram of a pearl; a table setting with six porcelain plates is decorated with images of a Victorian séance; barely visible watermarks on sheets of backlit paper depict UFO sightings; and an eerie circle of white hats levitate in a blue room. Examining the relationship between perception, sensation, and physical experience, Bloom’s work questions the idea that seeing is believing.2 Her installation is a kind of innuendo, one in which the framework is clear but the content is obscure, inviting us to fill in the blanks—perhaps on the way down the stairs.\n Susan Tallman, The Collections of Barbara Bloom (New York: International Center for Photography, 2007), 158–59. ↩ Lindsey M.

Their breakability implies absence.1 They are temporal and melancholic, reminding us of our own mortality. After the artist fell out of a third-story window in 1995 and broke many bones in her body, including her vertebrae, she became interested in the Japanese tradition of repairing broken ceramics with gold lacquer. Known as kintsugi, this technique highlights an object’s history and flaws rather than concealing its scars.2 Anchored in this practice, Bloom developed a deeply personal series called Broken (2001) of purposefully broken and repaired ceramics and photographic works, including X-ray images of the repaired pots, paper gift boxes printed with X-ray images of the artist’s reconstructed vertebrae, and a found photograph of an acrobat balancing a stack of teapots—the precarious image framed under a sheet of shattered glass.\n Barbara Bloom, interview with Kiki Smith, “Barbara Bloom,” BOMB, no. 54 (Winter 1996): 38. ↩ Susan Tallman, The Collections of Barbara Bloom (New York: International Center for Photography, 2007), 184–85. ↩   ","id":8,"length":170,"title":"Bloom 4B.

She is a collector of household objects, attuned to the often hidden or unseen meanings embedded within visual culture. Her installation The Bedroom (2017), for example, began at a flea market in Paris where she discovered a set of handpainted watercolors of domestic interiors from the 1960s with colorings and décor so opulent that they struck her as ridiculous. Upon removing the frame and mat of one, she was intrigued to discover that the margin of the paper was dense with exploratory brushwork. The juxtaposition of the expressive gesture and tight, even fussy, decorative interior can be seen in the carpet Bloom custom designed for The Bedroom. Bloom likes the double entendre inherent to objects with both utilitarian and decorative values, like carpet, which slip between the usable and ornamental, the everyday and high art.\n","id":9,"length":146,"title":"Bloom 4A.

He and a group of CalArts peers shared a “kaleidoscopic” approach to artmaking—a kind of interdisciplinary enterprise that encompasses music, text, images, sculpture, and performance.1 For his videos, Oursler wrote scripts and constructed characters from modest and often strange found materials—like kitchen spoons, bits of toilet paper, or painted cardboard—animating them within handpainted sets. The school’s outmoded Sony Portapak video cameras yielded fuzzy images with ghostly streaks that intrigued Oursler.2 Amusing, disorienting, and with an intentionally low-budget aesthetic, his surreal videos challenge the seamless editing of Hollywood productions, which slickly dissolve the distinctions between reality and media image.\n Tony Oursler, “Image of the People: Mike Kelley (1954–2012),” Artforum 50, no. 9 (May 2012): 330. ↩ Michael Kimmelman, “A Sculptor of the Air with Video,” New York Times, April 27, 2001. ↩   ","id":11,"length":151,"title":"Oursler Banner.

Calling them “mimetic technology”1—a term he borrows from pharmacology to describe drugs that emulate human consciousness—he is interested in the way television, film, and media imagery mimic human thought to engender seemingly real emotions. Oursler came to this realization watching a lot of television as a teenager. Influenced by his magician grandfather Fulton Oursler, he developed an understanding of how mimetic technology, through close approximation of reality, has the power to also alter our perception.2\n Tony Oursler, in “Smoke and Mirrors: Tony Oursler’s Influence Machine: A Conversation Between Tony Oursler and Louise Neri,” in Tony Oursler: The Influence Machine (London: Artangel; and New York: Public Art Fund, 2000), 56. ↩ Fred Nadis, “Of Linking Rings and Magic Lanterns: Tony Oursler’s Family Gothic,” in Imponderable: The Archives of Tony Oursler (Zurich: LUMA Foundation, 2015), 447–57. ↩   ","id":12,"length":153,"title":"Oursler 3A.

Light and the sounds of babbling voices materialize into sculpture. Known for his work projecting images through space onto various mediums—fiberglass armatures, paper, smoke—Oursler combines the intangible qualities of light with the physicality of material. In what he calls a “third space,”1 Oursler—whose grandfather Fulton Oursler was an accomplished magician skilled in the trickery of spirit photography2—explores the hypnotic effects and subtle, even insidious, power of mediated imagery. The Influence Machine takes its title from an early eighteenth-century invention, a spherical glass vacuum that had no practical use but emitted a mesmerizing green glow. This trance-inducing device was the precursor to the cathode ray tube used in early television technology.\n Tony Oursler, in “TateShots: Tony Oursler Studio Visit,” filmed January 2011 at Tony Oursler’s studio, New York, video, 4:19, available at http://tonyoursler.com/interviews. ↩ Fred Nadis, “Of Linking Rings and Magic Lanterns: Tony Oursler’s Family Gothic,” in Imponderable: The Archives of Tony Oursler (Zurich: LUMA Foundation, 2015), 454. ↩   ","id":13,"length":184,"title":"Oursler 4A.

Despite the alien forms of these “electronic effigies”1—as in the green, S-shaped Slip (2003)—their facial expressions and language communicate. Oursler’s scripts sound like stream-of-consciousness ramblings or, as he describes, “a sort of babble, like someone’s in a therapy session,”2 initiating unfinished narratives that the viewer is left to complete. Mirroring human struggle and humor, they play on human empathy; like film and television characters with whom we bond, they invite our affinity.3\n Tony Oursler, in “Who’s Making It: Tony Oursler,” Gotham TV segment, New York Metro TV, filmed 2001, video, 5:08, available at http://tonyoursler.com/interviews. ↩ Tony Oursler, “Who’s Making It: Tony Oursler,” Gotham TV segment, New York Metro TV, filmed 2001, video, 5:08, available at http://tonyoursler.com/interviews. ↩ Deborah Rothschild, “Introjection: In Oursler’s World, No One Escapes Its Unbidden Influences,” in Tony Oursler: Introjection, Mid-career Survey, 1976–1999 (Williamstown, MA: Williams College Museum of Art, 1999), 14. ↩   ","id":14,"length":168,"title":"Oursler 5A.

At twelve years old, the Moog synthesizer caught his attention, both for its mechanical sound as well as the beauty of its form. As a teenager he looked to musicians like Jimi Hendrix, who fused art with the machine when he incorporated guitar amplifier feedback into his innovative sound.1 Rath earned a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1982 and taught himself mechanical engineering through experimentation. Since then, Rath has built and programmed his own sculptures; from their circuit boards to the software that runs them, everything is handmade. There is an intimacy, or a kind of “feedback loop,”2 between the design and the build; each build informs the next design, so that technology itself is not just equipment, or material, it is also the subject matter of Rath’s work.3\n Alan Rath, in “Critic and Artist Residency Series: Alan Rath,” University Center for the Arts, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, filmed 2005, video, 1:02:14, available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW2nr9VeEas. ↩ Alan Rath, in “Critic and Artist Residency Series: Alan Rath,” University Center for the Arts, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, filmed 2005, video, 1:02:14, available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW2nr9VeEas. ↩ Peter Boswell, Viewpoints (Minneapolis: Walker Art Center, 1991), 1. ↩   ","id":16,"length":211,"title":"Rath Banner.

While studying electrical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Rath became interested in learning what he could get machines to do, rather than using machines to perform predetermined tasks.1 The software he writes to animate his sculptures privileges play over thinking, leading them to perform and modify their behavior in relation with the world around them. Using light and motion sensors, robots like Absolutely (2012) improvise their own movement. As the artist has stated, “I want to evoke that feeling of transience, information flow, and make objects which are active, alive, not passive.”2 Influenced by the work of John Cage and Buckminster Fuller, Rath believes the art of our time should move.3\n Peter Boswell, Viewpoints (Minneapolis: Walker Art Center, 1991), 1. ↩ Alan Rath, in Dana Friis-Hansen, Alan Rath: Bio-Mechanics: Perspectives 93 (Houston: Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, 1995), 4. ↩ Peter Boswell, Viewpoints (Minneapolis: Walker Art Center, 1991), 2. ↩   ","id":17,"length":172,"title":"Rath 5A.

Despite its synthetic quality, the sculpture’s form speaks to underlying similarities between human bodies and machines. Gesturing in American Sign Language messages like “batteries not included” and “objects in mirror are closer than they appear,” it mimics a sentient being overloaded with a litany of fragmented data. For the artist, electronic materials are basic elements of our everyday experience, which his sculptures embody in both form and content: “I am making a window on our world, a picture of what is ‘out there.’”1 Trained as an electrical engineer, he is interested not only in how technology facilitates a process but in the structure or logic of the system; here, electronics are the process and the object.2\n Dana Friis-Hansen, Alan Rath: Bio-Mechanics: Perspectives 93 (Houston: Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, 1995), 2. ↩ Peter Boswell, Viewpoints (Minneapolis: Walker Art Center, 1991), 2. ↩   ","id":18,"length":176,"title":"Rath 4A.

In the snail-like sculpture Thumper V (1996), a pair of pulsating speaker cones form the body and two smaller speakers perched on the tips of antennae suggest a pair of eyes. Moving at low, inaudible frequencies, the pulsing speakers seem to breathe and blink, mirroring the rhythms of the human body. In an era dominated by virtual movement, Rath became interested in the physical movement of motorized sculptures.

They invite us to enter physically engaging aesthetic experiences that dissolve the boundary between viewer and object.

Influenced by experimental film, which often uses repetition rather than a storyline to focus viewer attention on film’s materiality rather than its content alone, Jennifer Steinkamp features the trees without narrative. Instead, their movement is abstract, “the motion of pattern and cycle.”1 The tree’s motion and changes over time imbue it with a kind of mortal energy mimicking our somatic experience of living, breathing, sleeping.
