[{"content":"In the 1930s, during America\u0026rsquo;s worst financial crises, the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt employed photographers to document the plight of everyday folk in the Great Depression in order to push forward with their New Deal programs. Documentary photographers Dorothea Lange and Walker Evans were prolific frontrunners of these efforts and their extraordinary photographs continue to endure today. Their artistic and documentary mastery and historical importance provide key insight into a monumental turning point in American history.\n","id":0,"length":78,"title":"Cover","type":"cover","url":"https://aheltonsjma.github.io/50x50facetoface/"},{"content":"This is a starter theme for Quire, a multiformat digital publishing framework.

She worked for Arnold Genthe in his portrait studio in New York and studied photography with Clarence White at Columbia University. In 1918 she began to travel around the world to make her living as a photographer. She found herself stranded in San Francisco, so she opened a photographic studio there. Paul Taylor, who would become her second husband, hired her to document migratory workers in California.\nSHORTCODE ERROR: q-figure  The supplied value for id does not match an id value in your data/figures.yml file.

Upon his return to New York, he published his first images in 1930. During the Great Depression, Evans began to photograph for the Resettlement Administration, later known as the Farm Security Administration (FSA), documenting workers and architecture in the Southeastern states (fig. 2). In 1936 he traveled with the writer James Agee to illustrate an article on tenant farm families for Fortune magazine; the book Let Us Now Praise Famous Men came out of this collaboration.\nThroughout his career Evans contributed photographs to numerous publications, including three devoted solely to his work. In 1965 he left Fortune, where he had been a staff photographer for twenty years, to become a professor of photography and graphic design at Yale University. He remained in the position until 1974, a year before his death.\nSHORTCODE ERROR: q-figure  The supplied value for id does not match an id value in your data/figures.yml file.

While considering a position with the RA in the spring of 1935, he jotted down those things he would require of his employer, including the \u0026ldquo;guarantee of one-man performance,\u0026rdquo; and what he would provide, adding that he should not be asked to do anything more in the way of political propaganda: \u0026ldquo;[I] Mean never [to] make photographic statements for the government or do photographic chores for gov or anyone in gov, no matter how powerful—this is pure record not propaganda. The value and, if you like, even the propaganda value for the government lies in the record itself which in the long run will prove an intelligent and farsighted thing to have done.

Evans\u0026rsquo;s vision for documenting American life had begun to form much earlier; a letter drafted to his friend Ernestine Evans, an editor at J. B. Lippincott, in February of 1934, makes clear his aspirations:\n What do I want to do? \u0026hellip; I know now is the time for picture books. An American city is the best, Pittsburgh better than Washington. I know more about such a place. I would want to visit several besides Pittsburgh before deciding. Something perhaps smaller. Toledo, Ohio, maybe. Then I’m not sure a book of photos should be identified locally. American city is what I\u0026rsquo;m after\u0026hellip;. People, all classes, surrounded by bunches of the new down-and-out. Automobiles and the automobile landscape. Architecture, American urban taste, commerce, small scale, large scale, the city street atmosphere, the street smell, the hateful stuff, women\u0026rsquo;s clubs, fake culture, bad education, religion in decay\u0026hellip;.3\n The two men could find common ground in part due to the widespread influence of the 1929 publication Middletown: A Study in Modern American Culture by Robert and Helen Lynd, professors of sociology at Columbia and Sarah Lawrence, respectively. A 550-page field investigation by social anthropologists with subject headings including \u0026ldquo;What Middletown does to get its living\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;The houses in which Middletown lives,\u0026rdquo; this pioneering project attempted an objective analysis of life in a small Midwestern American city (Muncie, Indiana). The Lynds\u0026rsquo; study was hailed as a very accessible report that was most appealing because it made \u0026ldquo;no attempt to prove anything\u0026rdquo; but simply recorded \u0026ldquo;what was observed.\u0026rdquo; The Lynds introduced their topic by saying their goal \u0026ldquo;was to study synchronously the interwoven trends that are the life of a small American city. A typical city, strictly speaking, does not exist, but the city studied was selected a shaving many features in common to a wide group of communities.\u0026rdquo; ( SHORTCODE ERROR: q-cite  The short reference supplied doesn’t match one in the project’s references.yml file\n{{}}\nshort: \u0026#34;Faure 1909\u0026#34;  )\nSHORTCODE ERROR: q-figure  The supplied value for id does not match an id value in your data/figures.yml file.

The result was a \u0026ldquo;shooting script\u0026rdquo; for \u0026ldquo;things which should be photographed as American Background,\u0026rdquo; issued by Stryker to his team of photographers.

Between November 1935 and April 1936, Evans made two lengthy road trips that would account for the bulk of his entire production for the RA and many of the 169 mid-thirties pictures that follow this essay. From November to mid-January, here turned to industrial centers in Pennsylvania, finally spending some time in Pittsburgh, and went on to Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana, following to some extent the course outlined in the memorandum above. In February 1936, he left again, with a completely Southern itinerary that would take him through many small cities, some of them renowned for ante-bellum architecture and Civil War battles, in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, the Carolinas, and Virginia.\nIn the spring of 1936, Stryker approved a furlough for Evans to work on a Fortune story with James Agee. This leave for mid-July through mid-September allowed Evans to return to the \u0026ldquo;middle south\u0026rdquo; with Agee to prepare \u0026ldquo;an article on cotton tenantry in the United States, in the form of a photographic and verbal record of the daily lives and environment of an average white family of tenant farmers\u0026rdquo; (fig. 4, 5, 6, 7). ( SHORTCODE ERROR: q-cite  The short reference supplied doesn’t match one in the project’s references.yml file\n{{}}\nshort: \u0026#34;Faure 1909\u0026#34;  ) According to the terms of Stryker\u0026rsquo;s arrangement with Fortune\u0026rsquo;s art editor, the pictures Evans produced on this job would become the property of the RA after the magazine had run the finished essay in a fall issue.\n  SHORTCODE ERROR: q-figure-group  One or more of the id values supplied in this shortcode do not match any corresponding id values in your data/figures.yml file. Or, the id values were not fully comma separated.\n{{}}    Once Evans returned from this trip south, during which he and Agee documented the lives of the Burroughs, Fields, and Tengle families in Alabama (see Bud Fields with His Wife and Burrough\u0026rsquo;s Family), he spent September and October printing his pictures and preparing presentations for both Fortune and Stryker.6 Stryker again talked about a New England trip, on which he planned to accompany the photographer, but it did not materialize, and Evans was once more sent to the South, this time to photograph the catastrophe of flooding in Arkansas and Tennessee. An unusual and demanding assignment for Evans, this trip of late January and February 1937 was made with another RA photographer, Edwin Locke, and required that he spend considerable time in the affected area, photographing the flood victims and their temporary shelters.\nThis would be his last travel for the RA, an agency that was absorbed into the Farm Security Administration at about this time. Evans\u0026rsquo;s contributions to the RA\u0026rsquo;s documentation of Depression-era America had essentially been obtained between the summer of 1935 and the spring of 1936, a period of less than a year. The Alabama pictures made while on leave to Fortune would become his best-known photographs and, ironically, those most closely identified with his work as a New Deal photographer.\nThe events generated by the Museum of Modern Art in the fall of 1938 could be viewed as the culmination of a highly productive period made possible by the patronage of the federal government. The sequences of images that appeared in the exhibition and book of American Photo-graphs, though composed of different selections and gleaned from a decade of the photographer\u0026rsquo;s work, might just as appropriately have appeared under the title of \u0026ldquo;Middletown.\u0026rdquo; In fact, Kirstein refers to the Lynds\u0026rsquo; Middletown in his American Photographs essay, suggesting that, although Evans\u0026rsquo;s work should not be considered merely \u0026ldquo;illustrative accompaniment,\u0026rdquo; a study such as theirs \u0026ldquo;might have been more effective had it also been plotted in visual terms.\u0026rdquo; ( SHORTCODE ERROR: q-cite  The short reference supplied doesn’t match one in the project’s references.yml file\n{{}}\nshort: \u0026#34;Faure 1909\u0026#34;  ) An article by Anthony Westen titled \u0026ldquo;Middletown and Main Street,\u0026rdquo; one of the most insightful contemporary comments on Evans\u0026rsquo;s subject matter, appeared in Architectural Review to mark the publication of American Photographs. ( SHORTCODE ERROR: q-cite  The short reference supplied doesn’t match one in the project’s references.yml file\n{{}}\nshort: \u0026#34;Faure 1909\u0026#34;  )\nA closer look at two little-known RA images—one that appeared in both exhibition formats and one that appeared only in the book—provides a glimpse of how much the exhibitions and publication differed and of the way in which Evans went about editing his own work. Appearing almost in the very middle of the New York installation of American Photographs were two 1937 images of Arkansas flood refugees. One of them—a young African American woman asleep under a quilt in a heavy, metal-frame bed—is found in an almost square Getty print bearing an incomplete MoMA loan number. A second image of almost the same size—a person who looks more like an African American man, partially con-sealed behind a boldly patterned makeshift curtain—is also found at the Getty, but this print, apparently of the same vintage, does not possess a loan number or label. Both images have been severely cropped from the original negative.7 Prints of the two images hung as pendants in the New York show between a photograph of a poor Cuban family from 1933 and a picture of the Tengle family in Hale County, Alabama, singing hymns. The installation list for the circulating version of American Photographs calls for these two images to appear together, only this time toward the end of the show, in group XV (of eighteen groupings specified), where they would be part of a larger selection of seven pictures, including three Alabama tenant farmer images, two Cuban pictures of workingmen and women, and views of factories in Louisiana and wooden stores in Mississippi.\nSHORTCODE ERROR: q-figure  The supplied value for id does not match an id value in your data/figures.yml file. Or, if you are not using a data/figures.yml file, a value for src should also be included in the shortcode, and should match the filename of an image file in your static/img directory.\n{{}}\n{{}}   For the book, however, Evans chose a vertically oriented print from another negative of the sleeping woman mentioned above. This image (fig. 8), which might seem more invasive than intimate, is even more startling and unorthodox than the first. It presents the weary flood victim at bedside level, awake but nestled under the quilt. Below her on the floor of the old cotton warehouse that is supplying emergency shelter are a few items of clothing and a bedpan. Occurring at almost the exact center of the book—that is, as plate forty-four in a sequence of eighty-seven images—it falls between a van Gogh-like interior entitled Hudson Street Boarding House Detail, New York and a portrait of three working-class neighbors passing the time together in People in Summer, New York State Town. As comparative material from this winter of 1937 Arkansas assignment, three other prints in the Getty collection depict African American women displaced by the flood and huddled in or near a bed due to cold and illness. Like the two images chosen for the MoMA show, these three reflect substantial cropping of the negatives in an effort to close in on a single figure and eliminate the barn like interior of this uncomfortable temporary home.8 Always after portraits of \u0026ldquo;the anonymous people\u0026rdquo; of Middletown, Evans seems to have taken full advantage of the unusual vulnerability of these residents of Forrest City, Arkansas.\nEvans had company on this RA assignment, which must have been one of the hardest emotionally as well as technically of his career. The report submitted to Stryker by his more communicative colleague, Edwin Locke, gives an immediate picture of the conditions the two men found and the way they attempted to record them. It also con-firms Evans\u0026rsquo;s perfectionist nature, his persistent determination to get the right picture, and the reasons why Roy Stryker, like Tom Mabry, valued his work so highly. The handwritten letter on hotel stationery reads in part:\n My God, we are tired tonight! Got up at 6 this morning, worked until 5:30 PM, made the 6:20 PM train back to Memphis, having covered the refugee camps as well as we could without flashes. And now a word about the camps: L White camp (about 2 miles away from Negro camp—we covered this twice on foot with equipment): well run, adequate tent space, good (regular army) food. A detachment of soldiers from Fort Leavenworth are running the outfit along with the CCC\u0026hellip;. The Negro camp: Overcrowded. There are many more negroes than whites affected by flood in this area. Found 11 in one tent. They are not \u0026ldquo;happy-go-lucky\u0026rdquo; about it, but dazed, apathetic, and hopeless. There is a good deal of illness: excruciating coughs, pneumonia and influenza cases laying in a dark cotton warehouse. I shot in there with the Leica, but Walker said it was too dark. He bought photoflashes and shot with the 4x5, but is afraid that the exposures were wrong. He will undoubtedly want to go back\u0026hellip;.9\n Evans and Stryker parted ways, mostly because of the bureaucratic requirements that Stryker adhered to. Working under difficult conditions was certainly not some-thing the photographer shied away from, particularly when he was after the archetypal portrait of \u0026ldquo;Everyman\u0026rdquo; that he treasured. In pursuit of this goal, for his next major series Evans would contrive to photograph only by remote shutter release while riding the New York subway in winter.\nNotes   Memorandum draft by Walker Evans, reproduced in Walker Evans at Work, (New York: Harper and Row, 1982), 112. ↩ Walker Evans to Ernestine Evans, unfinished two-page letter in black ink on hotel stationery, dated Feb. 1934, first published in Walker Evans at Work, 98.

The artist describes her often domestic-feeling interior spaces “like a movie set,”2 in which objects with assorted histories and styles evoke specific anecdotes.

Borrowing this expression for the title, Barbara Bloom’s 1988 installation captures a sense of the unknown. The end is visible from the entrance of its four successive rooms, but their enigmatic contents, framed and reframed as one moves through the spaces, suggest the limits of visibility.1 Framed Braille texts and words too small to read hang on the walls; a saucer-shaped dish holds a hologram of a pearl; a table setting with six porcelain plates is decorated with images of a Victorian séance; barely visible watermarks on sheets of backlit paper depict UFO sightings; and an eerie circle of white hats levitate in a blue room. Examining the relationship between perception, sensation, and physical experience, Bloom’s work questions the idea that seeing is believing.2 Her installation is a kind of innuendo, one in which the framework is clear but the content is obscure, inviting us to fill in the blanks—perhaps on the way down the stairs.\n Susan Tallman, The Collections of Barbara Bloom (New York: International Center for Photography, 2007), 158–59. ↩ Lindsey M.

After the artist fell out of a third-story window in 1995 and broke many bones in her body, including her vertebrae, she became interested in the Japanese tradition of repairing broken ceramics with gold lacquer. Known as kintsugi, this technique highlights an object’s history and flaws rather than concealing its scars.2 Anchored in this practice, Bloom developed a deeply personal series called Broken (2001) of purposefully broken and repaired ceramics and photographic works, including X-ray images of the repaired pots, paper gift boxes printed with X-ray images of the artist’s reconstructed vertebrae, and a found photograph of an acrobat balancing a stack of teapots—the precarious image framed under a sheet of shattered glass.\n Barbara Bloom, interview with Kiki Smith, “Barbara Bloom,” BOMB, no. 54 (Winter 1996): 38. ↩ Susan Tallman, The Collections of Barbara Bloom (New York: International Center for Photography, 2007), 184–85. ↩   ","id":9,"length":170,"title":"Balance No. 1 (Purple Head Stack) from the series Broken","type":"entry","url":"https://aheltonsjma.github.io/50x50facetoface/catalogue/bloom/bloom3/"},{"content":"Barbara Bloom finds inspiration for her conceptual practice in ordinary things. She is a collector of household objects, attuned to the often hidden or unseen meanings embedded within visual culture. Her installation The Bedroom (2017), for example, began at a flea market in Paris where she discovered a set of handpainted watercolors of domestic interiors from the 1960s with colorings and décor so opulent that they struck her as ridiculous. Upon removing the frame and mat of one, she was intrigued to discover that the margin of the paper was dense with exploratory brushwork. The juxtaposition of the expressive gesture and tight, even fussy, decorative interior can be seen in the carpet Bloom custom designed for The Bedroom. Bloom likes the double entendre inherent to objects with both utilitarian and decorative values, like carpet, which slip between the usable and ornamental, the everyday and high art.\n","id":10,"length":146,"title":"A Philosophical Practice","type":"entry","url":"https://aheltonsjma.github.io/50x50facetoface/catalogue/bloom/bloom4/"},{"content":"“The face has always been important in my work.

He and a group of CalArts peers shared a “kaleidoscopic” approach to artmaking—a kind of interdisciplinary enterprise that encompasses music, text, images, sculpture, and performance.1 For his videos, Oursler wrote scripts and constructed characters from modest and often strange found materials—like kitchen spoons, bits of toilet paper, or painted cardboard—animating them within handpainted sets. The school’s outmoded Sony Portapak video cameras yielded fuzzy images with ghostly streaks that intrigued Oursler.2 Amusing, disorienting, and with an intentionally low-budget aesthetic, his surreal videos challenge the seamless editing of Hollywood productions, which slickly dissolve the distinctions between reality and media image.\n Tony Oursler, “Image of the People: Mike Kelley (1954–2012),” Artforum 50, no. 9 (May 2012): 330. ↩ Michael Kimmelman, “A Sculptor of the Air with Video,” New York Times, April 27, 2001. ↩   ","id":12,"length":151,"title":"Members of the Poetics","type":"entry","url":"https://aheltonsjma.github.io/50x50facetoface/catalogue/oursler/oursler1/"},{"content":"Tony Oursler thinks of television and film like psychedelic drugs that induce a dream space, parallel to reality. Calling them “mimetic technology”1—a term he borrows from pharmacology to describe drugs that emulate human consciousness—he is interested in the way television, film, and media imagery mimic human thought to engender seemingly real emotions. Oursler came to this realization watching a lot of television as a teenager. Influenced by his magician grandfather Fulton Oursler, he developed an understanding of how mimetic technology, through close approximation of reality, has the power to also alter our perception.2\n Tony Oursler, in “Smoke and Mirrors: Tony Oursler’s Influence Machine: A Conversation Between Tony Oursler and Louise Neri,” in Tony Oursler: The Influence Machine (London: Artangel; and New York: Public Art Fund, 2000), 56. ↩ Fred Nadis, “Of Linking Rings and Magic Lanterns: Tony Oursler’s Family Gothic,” in Imponderable: The Archives of Tony Oursler (Zurich: LUMA Foundation, 2015), 447–57. ↩   ","id":13,"length":153,"title":"Video Projections No. 59","type":"entry","url":"https://aheltonsjma.github.io/50x50facetoface/catalogue/oursler/oursler2/"},{"content":"With blinking eyes and whispering lips, Tony Oursler’s projections of faces onto fiberglass sculptures create lifelike figures that make media imagery tangible. Despite the alien forms of these “electronic effigies”1—as in the green, S-shaped Slip (2003)—their facial expressions and language communicate. Oursler’s scripts sound like stream-of-consciousness ramblings or, as he describes, “a sort of babble, like someone’s in a therapy session,”2 initiating unfinished narratives that the viewer is left to complete. Mirroring human struggle and humor, they play on human empathy; like film and television characters with whom we bond, they invite our affinity.3\n Tony Oursler, in “Who’s Making It: Tony Oursler,” Gotham TV segment, New York Metro TV, filmed 2001, video, 5:08, available at http://tonyoursler.com/interviews. ↩ Tony Oursler, “Who’s Making It: Tony Oursler,” Gotham TV segment, New York Metro TV, filmed 2001, video, 5:08, available at http://tonyoursler.com/interviews. ↩ Deborah Rothschild, “Introjection: In Oursler’s World, No One Escapes Its Unbidden Influences,” in Tony Oursler: Introjection, Mid-career Survey, 1976–1999 (Williamstown, MA: Williams College Museum of Art, 1999), 14. ↩   ","id":14,"length":168,"title":"Slip","type":"entry","url":"https://aheltonsjma.github.io/50x50facetoface/catalogue/oursler/oursler4/"},{"content":"Faces and moving images are eerily projected into clouds of smoke and on trees and walls in Tony Oursler’s multiple-projection outdoor installation The Influence Machine (2000). Light and the sounds of babbling voices materialize into sculpture. Known for his work projecting images through space onto various mediums—fiberglass armatures, paper, smoke—Oursler combines the intangible qualities of light with the physicality of material. In what he calls a “third space,”1 Oursler—whose grandfather Fulton Oursler was an accomplished magician skilled in the trickery of spirit photography2—explores the hypnotic effects and subtle, even insidious, power of mediated imagery. The Influence Machine takes its title from an early eighteenth-century invention, a spherical glass vacuum that had no practical use but emitted a mesmerizing green glow.
