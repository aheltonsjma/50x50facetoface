You make a line, a two-dimensional line, then you go into space, and you have a three-dimensional piece. It’s like a drawing in space.”2 With the simple e-shaped crochet loop, she could draw and sculpt simultaneously. Asawa always began from the inside out, creating orbs that seem to float within larger spheres. The outside surface of the smaller sphere folds over to become the inside surface of the sphere around it so, like a line, there is continuity.\n Paul J.

At Black Mountain, teachers privileged problem solving and the process of making art as much as the final object.1 The school’s spirit of discipline, economy, and resourceful creativity echoed that of her upbringing during the Great Depression in Norwalk, California, a small agricultural town in Los Angeles County, where her family worked on a large-production vegetable farm. Albers instructed that all materials, no matter how common, have potential. Under his direction, her exercises in repetition, pattern, and form2 on paper—her attention would soon turn from paper to copper and brass wire—taught her how to allow shape to emerge from a material rather than impose predetermined ideas upon it.3 Meanwhile, Fuller’s ideas about the connections between design and society and his commitment to addressing basic needs like shelter, as in his geodesic dome, instilled in Asawa a belief in the continuity of the self, art, and society.4 With these integrated approaches to art making as a model, her practice would span from individual objects to public monuments to the Alvarado School Art Workshop—a community-based arts program Asawa started in 1968 in San Francisco public schools.\n Karin Higa, “What Is an Asian American Woman Artist?” in Art, Women, California 1950–2000: Parallels and Intersections, ed.

Created during the 1950s and 60s, these lobe sculptures made of crocheted wire, like Untitled (S.035, Hanging Six-Lobed, Multilayered Interlocking Continuous Form within a Form with Spheres in the Second, Fifth, and Sixth [Lobes), from \u0026ldquo;Group of Architectural Works\u0026rdquo; (c. 1962), defy categorization. They evoke traditional craft, like weaving and basketmaking, but their nonutilitarian forms demonstrate an interest in abstraction; their play with positive and negative space suggest both volume and weightlessness; and their attention to line, particularly evident in the shadows they cast, approaches drawing. The biomorphic forms and dimensionality of Asawa’s sculptures can be understood through the influence of both dance and architecture at Black Mountain College, where Asawa took classes with choreographer Merce Cunningham1 and met her husband Albert Lanier, who was studying architecture. Though nonfigurative, the artist’s long lobe installations recall the proportions of the body and the built environment. While made up of a stable, rigid structure, their wavy and intertwining shapes are “vaguely anthropomorphic [in the] way they hold space, each one acting as an analogue for a human body.”2\n Jennifer Gross, “Ruth Asawa: Dancers,” in Leap Before You Look: Black Mountain College, 1933–1957 ed.

Asawa, with her family, had been interned in 1942 at a camp in Rohwer, Arkansas.1 She designed a narrative monument with figurative imagery to depict the history of the Japanese-American community in California before internment—stories of immigration, agriculture, small business, and culture—as well as experiences in the camps.2 On each end of the monument, pictorial scenes are framed by symbolic mon, or family crests that Asawa collected from 177 Japanese-American families in San José.

The artist describes her often domestic-feeling interior spaces “like a movie set,”2 in which objects with assorted histories and styles evoke specific anecdotes. However, she teases out their eccentricities and poetry to build layered meaning. Bloom never tells a complete or straightforward story. Rather, her works imply potential narratives to be completed by the viewer.\n Barbara Bloom, in a discussion with Simon Critchley, Robert Storr, and Joerg Heiser, “Scenes from a Marriage: Have Art and Theory Drifted Apart?,” Frieze Talks, Frieze Art Fair, London, October 16, 2009, audio, 1:28:15, https://frieze.com/fair-programme/listen-scenes-marriage. ↩ Margot Mifflin, “Barbara Bloom,” ARTnews 92 (February 1993): 103. ↩   ","id":11,"length":166,"title":"Bloom Banner.

Borrowing this expression for the title, Barbara Bloom’s 1988 installation captures a sense of the unknown. The end is visible from the entrance of its four successive rooms, but their enigmatic contents, framed and reframed as one moves through the spaces, suggest the limits of visibility.1 Framed Braille texts and words too small to read hang on the walls; a saucer-shaped dish holds a hologram of a pearl; a table setting with six porcelain plates is decorated with images of a Victorian séance; barely visible watermarks on sheets of backlit paper depict UFO sightings; and an eerie circle of white hats levitate in a blue room. Examining the relationship between perception, sensation, and physical experience, Bloom’s work questions the idea that seeing is believing.2 Her installation is a kind of innuendo, one in which the framework is clear but the content is obscure, inviting us to fill in the blanks—perhaps on the way down the stairs.\n Susan Tallman, The Collections of Barbara Bloom (New York: International Center for Photography, 2007), 158–59. ↩ Lindsey M.

Their breakability implies absence.1 They are temporal and melancholic, reminding us of our own mortality. After the artist fell out of a third-story window in 1995 and broke many bones in her body, including her vertebrae, she became interested in the Japanese tradition of repairing broken ceramics with gold lacquer. Known as kintsugi, this technique highlights an object’s history and flaws rather than concealing its scars.2 Anchored in this practice, Bloom developed a deeply personal series called Broken (2001) of purposefully broken and repaired ceramics and photographic works, including X-ray images of the repaired pots, paper gift boxes printed with X-ray images of the artist’s reconstructed vertebrae, and a found photograph of an acrobat balancing a stack of teapots—the precarious image framed under a sheet of shattered glass.\n Barbara Bloom, interview with Kiki Smith, “Barbara Bloom,” BOMB, no. 54 (Winter 1996): 38. ↩ Susan Tallman, The Collections of Barbara Bloom (New York: International Center for Photography, 2007), 184–85. ↩   ","id":13,"length":170,"title":"Bloom 4B.

She is a collector of household objects, attuned to the often hidden or unseen meanings embedded within visual culture. Her installation The Bedroom (2017), for example, began at a flea market in Paris where she discovered a set of handpainted watercolors of domestic interiors from the 1960s with colorings and décor so opulent that they struck her as ridiculous. Upon removing the frame and mat of one, she was intrigued to discover that the margin of the paper was dense with exploratory brushwork. The juxtaposition of the expressive gesture and tight, even fussy, decorative interior can be seen in the carpet Bloom custom designed for The Bedroom. Bloom likes the double entendre inherent to objects with both utilitarian and decorative values, like carpet, which slip between the usable and ornamental, the everyday and high art.\n","id":14,"length":146,"title":"Bloom 4A.

While not a musician, he likes “that these little objects have a voice and can be manipulated.”1 The artist’s best-known installation, Überorgan (2000), is a colossal music machine: a system of plastic bags, ducts, and pipes that inflates, bellowing to the score of a player piano. Forced air rushes through metal horn-shaped funnels and several miles of plastic sheeting that form large balloons and extensive tubes snaking through multiple rooms. Covering the square footage of a football field, it breathes and groans like a living organism. The organ is at once an instrument and a gargantuan system of entrails. Hawkinson, who is interested in the logic of systems of both humans and machines, is drawn to “interference patterns—the way overlapping patterns can create another pattern or rhythm.”2\n Tim Hawkinson, in “In the Studio: Tim Hawkinson with David Coggins,” Art in America, May 2009, 88. ↩ Tim Hawkinson, in “In the Studio: Tim Hawkinson with David Coggins,” Art in America, May 2009, 88. ↩   ","id":17,"length":171,"title":"Hawkinson 3A.

Typical of Hawkinson’s eccentric aesthetic, *Scout*’s skin is made of cardboard boxes from the garment factory adjacent to the artist’s Los Angeles studio, stitched together.

It’s using my face because that’s readily available, I have exclusive rights to my face \u0026hellip; it seems just honest to use my own face\u0026hellip; . Sometimes the manipulation is really slight, depending on what’s coming through the TV channel. When there’s a sporting event with lots of activity, the face can be pretty emotional.”2 While Hawkinson’s body figures prominently in his work and even in his materials—Bird (1997) is a two-inch-tall bird skeleton made of the artist’s fingernail clippings—his examinations are not self-reflective introspection.

Despite its synthetic quality, the sculpture’s form speaks to underlying similarities between human bodies and machines. Gesturing in American Sign Language messages like “batteries not included” and “objects in mirror are closer than they appear,” it mimics a sentient being overloaded with a litany of fragmented data. For the artist, electronic materials are basic elements of our everyday experience, which his sculptures embody in both form and content: “I am making a window on our world, a picture of what is ‘out there.’”1 Trained as an electrical engineer, he is interested not only in how technology facilitates a process but in the structure or logic of the system; here, electronics are the process and the object.2\n Dana Friis-Hansen, Alan Rath: Bio-Mechanics: Perspectives 93 (Houston: Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, 1995), 2. ↩ Peter Boswell, Viewpoints (Minneapolis: Walker Art Center, 1991), 2. ↩   ","id":28,"length":176,"title":"Rath 4A.

In the snail-like sculpture Thumper V (1996), a pair of pulsating speaker cones form the body and two smaller speakers perched on the tips of antennae suggest a pair of eyes. Moving at low, inaudible frequencies, the pulsing speakers seem to breathe and blink, mirroring the rhythms of the human body. In an era dominated by virtual movement, Rath became interested in the physical movement of motorized sculptures. Like human surrogates, they point to the complex relationship of humans to technology, offering “critical alter egos to the sleek, efficient machines that surround us in daily life.”2\n Alan Rath, in Kenneth Baker, “Alan Rath: Digital World,” ARTnews, May 1992, 70. ↩ Peter Boswell, Viewpoints (Minneapolis: Walker Art Center, 1991), 1. ↩   ","id":29,"length":161,"title":"Rath 3A.

Without beginning or end, they cycle through the seasons, bearing colorful blossoms then lush summer leaves and russet fall colors before losing their foliage. Influenced by experimental film, which often uses repetition rather than a storyline to focus viewer attention on film’s materiality rather than its content alone, Jennifer Steinkamp features the trees without narrative. Instead, their movement is abstract, “the motion of pattern and cycle.”1 The tree’s motion and changes over time imbue it with a kind of mortal energy mimicking our somatic experience of living, breathing, sleeping.

In one saw; the other saw (2001), a light and sound installation at Rice University Art Gallery on which she collaborated with the composer Jimmy Johnson, a projection on the gallery’s glass-front wall created the illusion of three dimensionality from both the interior and exterior of the space. “I use light to dematerialize architecture,” says Steinkamp.1 Using sensors to detect the movement of passersby, the projected image shifted in response to the viewer’s point of view so that the architecture itself seemed to be moving.2 Such motion-filled environments defy architecture’s space and material structure to induce visceral responses that border on vertigo and alter one’s mental state.\n Jennifer Steinkamp and Jimmy Johnson: one saw; the other saw (2001), exhibition description on Rice University Art Gallery website, http://www.ricegallery.org/steinkamp-johnson. ↩ Rochelle Steiner, Wonderland (St. Louis: Saint Louis Art Museum, 2000), 24. ↩   ","id":34,"length":202,"title":"Steinkamp 5A.

Playing with the temporal and spatial qualities inherent to film and video installation, Thater considers the ways media—like traditional Hollywood films and nature documentaries—shape our understanding of the world around us. She says, “It’s really about questioning how we know animals, how is information about animals delivered to us\u0026hellip; . I want us to find different ways to think through living, and different ways to construct power. How do we think about the natural world in a way that doesn’t destroy it?”1 A pioneer of video installation art, Thater models her work on animal environments, exploring video’s capacity for imagining nonnarrative time and expanded perception to induce a sympathetic response.\n Diana Thater, in “Diana Thater: ‘Delphine,’” *Art21/*Extended Play, episode 240 (October 2016), video, 4:25 minutes, available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR8hHg06ooY. ↩   ","id":36,"length":153,"title":"Thater Banner.

Seen at our feet, their fractured images of a butterfly slowly flapping its wings alter how viewers see dimensionality in video, suggesting that the experience of space, like images, is constructed.\n “Diana Thater: The Artist’s Museum,” The Museum of Contemporary Art Los Angeles, filmed 2010, video, 4:11, available at https://vimeo.com/16326381. ↩ Diana Thater, in Lynne Cooke, “Interview with Diana Thater,” September 14, 2014, published in Diana Thater: The Sympathetic Imagination (Los Angeles: Los Angeles County Museum of Art; and Munich: Prestel Verlag, 2015), 22. ↩   ","id":37,"length":224,"title":"Thater 3A.

Images projected at various angles wrap around corners of the gallery and bend onto the ceiling and floor. The installation itself, overlaying the constraints of human architecture with a volumetric space, is informed by the way dolphins interact with their environment.

For Thater, light is not illusionistic but experiential: “It’s something that needs to be navigated and it’s something that needs to be survived. But to a fish, water is an invisibility the same way space is to us.
